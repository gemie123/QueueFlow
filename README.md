# Project Background
Global shark attacks, recorded from as early as 1868 through to 2017, have increased public fear and apprehension towards sharks, especially amongst tourists, surfers and beach lovers.

There is a significant amount of data regarding locations, dates, information on the victims and the circumstances surrounding the occurrence, such as the victim's activities before the attack. This project carefully analyses the data to reveal critical insights that will improve coastal safety measures and educate the public on this matter to safely enjoy the ocean.

Insights and recommendations emerge from these key areas:

- **Geographic Area Focus:**  Evaluation of primary locations of these attacks, including country, city and areas, focusing on the time of day these attacks occurred, offering a better understanding of peak times for such attacks

- **High Risk Activities:**  An analysis of potentially risky behaviours and activities that may have contributed to the incidents and an evaluation of their influence/impact on the likelihood of attacks and understanding their impact on it.

- **Key Shark species:** An analysis of the shark species dominating the attacks

- **Regional Comparison:**  A comparison of attack patterns across different regions

For a dynamic exploration of the data, an interactive PowerBI dashboard can be found [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOGEzZGFiYmMtYjIxYy00N2IwLWJjM2UtZjliZjRmMTdjOTg4IiwidCI6ImU4Y2RiYjFmLWYwNzItNDk5Mi05ZTYzLWNiZDEzMDM0OTBmNSIsImMiOjh9)

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The  main database structure, as seen below, consists of a single table with a total row count of 6095 records. A description of each table is as follows:

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Shark attacks remained fairly constant between 1990 and 2016. The year 2015 recorded the highest number of shark attacks. There was a noticeable decline in 2017, and it is predicted to continue declining over the coming years. This prediction is broadly linked to increased awareness, better human behaviours around water and the changes caused by the recent pandemic in 2020.  The USA accounted for 35% of these incidents, with Florida as the area with the most attacks worldwide. Surfers and swimmers made up 30% of the victims, and about 15% of the attacks happened during surfing activities. 

The following sections will look into other contributing factors and emphasise areas for improvement.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Data Gaps (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Underreporting  and Misreporting (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
