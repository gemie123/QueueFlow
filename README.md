# Client Background

QueueFlow is a US-based SaaS company that provides a cloud-based software platform to a growing customer base.

QueueFlow serves approximately 35,000 active customers and handled over 120,000 inbound customer support calls over the past five months. These calls span multiple support queues corresponding to different issue types and customer tiers, each governed by defined service-level agreements (SLAs). The available data includes previously underutilized detailed call logs, agent staffing schedules, queue configurations, and post-call customer satisfaction surveys. The objective of this analysis is to identify operational risks driven by demand variability and to provide data-driven recommendations to improve service reliability and efficiency.

Reporting to the Head of Operations, this analysis focuses on insights across the following key areas:

North Star Metrics

Customer Experience Outcomes – Analyzing wait times, abandonment rates, and CSAT across queues, customer tiers, and issue categories to understand how operational performance impacts customer satisfaction.

Demand & Capacity Health – Evaluating call inflow, throughput, and capacity risk to assess whether operational resources are sufficient to meet demand.

Service Quality & Agent Effectiveness – Measuring agent productivity and service quality using average handle time, utilization, occupancy, and first-contact resolution to ensure efficient and sustainable service delivery.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
