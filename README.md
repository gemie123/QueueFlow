# Project Background
Global shark attacks, recorded from as early as 1868 through to 2017, have increased public fear and apprehension towards sharks , especially amongst tourists, surfers and beach lovers.

There is a significant amount of data regarding locations, dates, information on the victims and the circumstances surrounding the occurrence, such as the victim's activities before the attack. This project carefully analyses the data to reveal critical insights that will improve coastal safety measures and educate the public on this matter to safely enjoy the ocean.

Insights and recommendations emerge from these key areas:

- **Geographic Area Focus:**  Evaluation of primary locations of these attacks inlucing, country, city and areas focusing on the time of the day these attacks occured offering a better understanding of peak times for such attacks

- **High Risk Activities:**  An analysis of potentially risky behaviours and activities that may have contributed to the incidents and an evaluation of their influence/impact on the likelihood of attacks and understanding their impact on it.

- **Key Shark species:** An analysis of the shark species dominating the attacks

- **Regional Comparison:**  A comparison of attack patterns across different regions

For a dynamic exploration of the data, an interactive PowerBI dashboard can be found here [[link](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOGEzZGFiYmMtYjIxYy00N2IwLWJjM2UtZjliZjRmMTdjOTg4IiwidCI6ImU4Y2RiYjFmLWYwNzItNDk5Mi05ZTYzLWNiZDEzMDM0OTBmNSIsImMiOjh9)].

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The  main database structure, as seen below consists of a single table: with a total row count of 6095 records. A description of each table is as follows:

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
